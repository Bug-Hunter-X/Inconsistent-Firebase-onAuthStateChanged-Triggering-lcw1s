# Inconsistent Firebase onAuthStateChanged Triggering

This repository demonstrates a bug and its solution related to the Firebase `onAuthStateChanged` listener's inconsistent behavior under unstable network conditions. The issue occurs when the network connection fluctuates, causing the listener to miss authentication state changes or report them inaccurately.

## Bug Description

The `onAuthStateChanged` listener is crucial for managing user authentication in Firebase applications. However, unreliable network connectivity can lead to the listener not always triggering, resulting in the app presenting an incorrect user status or failing to appropriately update the UI according to the current authentication state. This inconsistency can severely impact the user experience and lead to unexpected behavior. 

## Solution

The proposed solution focuses on implementing more robust error handling and state management to gracefully handle network interruptions. It leverages the combination of a loading indicator and potential fallback mechanisms to provide a smoother experience while maintaining the accuracy of the user authentication state. 

## Code Samples

The `inconsistentAuth.js` file demonstrates the buggy behavior, while `consistentAuthSolution.js` offers a revised implementation with improved error handling to mitigate network connection inconsistencies.
